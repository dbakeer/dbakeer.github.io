##Introduction

###The process of making this game was a great experience in that it taught me the necessary process to make native code, the logic of organization and the means to make a basic working game.

###As simple as Tic Tac Toe may seem, it was a learning process. There could have been simpler ways to do this, but I am glad I explored the longer route as it helped me flex and develop coding skills.

##The Wireframe

###Before beginning the actual coding of the project, I wrote down the entire wireframe and plan of attack for the project. I purposefully designed a very simplified HTML/CSS design and intended it to be clean and minimalist.
